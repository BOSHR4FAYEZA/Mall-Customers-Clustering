# Mall-Customers-Clustering
Customer segmentation using clustering and anomaly detection (KMeans, DBSCAN, PCA)
# 🛍️ Mall Customers Segmentation & Anomaly Detection

This project uses **unsupervised learning** techniques to segment mall customers and detect unusual behaviors, helping businesses better understand their customer base.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Segment customers based on their demographic and spending behavior.
- Reduce dimensionality for better visualization and interpretation.
- Detect anomalies that might represent outliers or special patterns.

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset contains information about mall customers including:
- Gender
- Age
- Annual Income
- Spending Score

## 🧪 Techniques Used
- **Dimensionality Reduction:**
  - PCA (Principal Component Analysis)
  - t-SNE (t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding)

- **Clustering Algorithms:**
  - KMeans
  - MiniBatch KMeans
  - DBSCAN

- **Anomaly Detection:**
  - Isolation Forest
  - One-Class SVM

## 📌 Key Results
- Customers were grouped into clear clusters based on income and spending habits.
- PCA and t-SNE helped visualize high-dimensional data in 2D.
- Outliers were successfully identified using both Isolation Forest and One-Class SVM.
